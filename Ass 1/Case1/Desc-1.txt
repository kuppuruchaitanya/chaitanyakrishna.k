Case 1:
Parse the give command line and display in the below format
Input: parser.exe 1 a sss 4.5643
Output:
Type         Vaule Size of
Char           A    X
Int            1    X
String        Sss   X
Float/double 4.5643 X

-> Java does not provide anything like C's sizeof().

->However, let's consider why a Java programmer might occasionally want it.

->Java object allocation and construction are tied together (it is impossible to use an allocated but uninitialized object instance). If a Java class defines fields that are references to further objects, it is also common to set them at construction time. 

->Allocating a Java object therefore frequently allocates numerous interconnected object instances: an object graph. Coupled with automatic garbage collection, this is all too convenient and can make you feel like you never have to worry about Java memory allocation details.
